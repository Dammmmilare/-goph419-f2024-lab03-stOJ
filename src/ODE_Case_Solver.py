#Parameters:

phi = 51.0486 # Latitude in Calgary,Alberta.
g0 = 9.811636 # measured in  m/s^2.
dg_dz = 3.086*10-6 #g′ ≈ 0.3086 mGal/m where 1 Gal = 1 cm/s2, so in SI units, g′ ≈ (m/s2)/m.
rho_steel = 7800 # measured in  kg/m3.
d = 0.015 # density converted to m from cm (1.5cm).
μ_air =  1.827*10-5 # measured in kg/(m⋅s).





#Returns
